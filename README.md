# SPLURTY WEB APPLICATION

Splurty is a web application that allows users to enter quotes and information about themselves. The qoutes are then displayed at random on the home page and the information about the user is displayed in the about page. A characteristic of the database-driven web application is that it connects to databases to store user-generated data. The application can be defined as a database-powered quote generator with a mobile-first design, using the Ruby on Rails framework, HTML, and CSS. It Uses Git and GitHub for version control, and launched on Heroku.

Construct the web development pipeline: git, github and heroku. This will save and run the application code in the development and production environment. 

Set up models and database, build the infrastructure which includes controllers, routes tables and view files.
